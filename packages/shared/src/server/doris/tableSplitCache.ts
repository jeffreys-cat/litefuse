/**
 * In-memory snapshot of the doris_project_table_split control table, so that
 * isSplitProject can stay SYNCHRONOUS (it backs tableFor, called at hundreds of
 * sync SQL-build sites — making it async would ripple through the whole query
 * layer). Only relevant when LITEFUSE_DORIS_TABLE_SPLIT_MODE = project_id_with_rule.
 *
 * Design invariants (docs/project-per-table-*.md §二):
 *   - NO negative caching: the snapshot holds ONLY split=true projects; a miss
 *     means "not split". A newly-split project appears at the next refresh; there
 *     is no negative entry that could pin a project to the wrong answer.
 *   - Full atomic replace: each refresh swaps in a brand-new Map. A failed
 *     refresh keeps the LAST good snapshot (logged, never overwrite good data
 *     with an error) — or null on cold start.
 *   - Readiness: snapshot === null means "never loaded". Reads tolerate this
 *     (default to the shared table); the WRITE path must gate on
 *     isSplitCacheReady() and fail-and-retry rather than misroute a split
 *     project's rows to the shared table (wired in Stage 1.3/1.6).
 *
 * Ordering that keeps this safe (Stage 1.2/1.3): the creation hook creates the
 * two BASE tables (events_full_<pid> / traces_scalar_<pid> — fast) BEFORE the
 * control row flips split=true, so once split=true is visible the base tables
 * exist (reads return empty until data; writes have a target). The MV
 * (trace_metrics_agg_<pid>) is provisioned async and gated separately — it only
 * affects the rollup rewrite, not correctness (base queries have a fallback).
 *
 * Staleness window (CLOSED): with periodic refresh alone, a just-flipped split
 * project would keep reading not-split in OTHER processes for up to the refresh
 * interval, and a grouper cut during that lag would route to the SHARED table
 * → stranded rows. Both halves of the fix have landed: the eager Redis-pub/sub
 * invalidation broadcast below (control-table change → every process refreshes
 * immediately) and the write-path fail-and-retry gate on isSplitCacheReady()
 * (OtelIngestionProcessor). So the cross-process staleness window is no longer
 * the constraint.
 *
 * REMAINING operational caveat (until Stage 2): still only flip split=true for a
 * project that is not yet ingesting — NOT because of staleness, but because
 * splitting an ALREADY-ingesting project can poison an in-flight shared-shard
 * group (Stage 1 review #3: a mixed group whose entries[0] just became split
 * routes the whole group to events_full_<pid>). Stage 2 adds the active-project
 * guard; until then, designate at project creation, before the first trace.
